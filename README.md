🟢 Java Variables Programs

A collection of simple Java programs demonstrating Local, Instance, and Static variables in Java.

Overview

This repository contains three Java programs showcasing different types of variables in Java:

Local Variables – Variables declared inside a method or block and accessible only within that scope.

Instance Variables – Variables tied to a specific instance of a class (object).

Static Variables – Class-level variables shared across all instances of the class.

These examples are perfect for beginners to understand how variables behave differently depending on their scope and type.

Programs
1️⃣ Datatypes.java – Local Variables

Demonstrates the usage of local variables.

Variables are declared and initialized inside the main method.

Shows basic operations like input from the user and arithmetic operations.

2️⃣ EmployeeDetails.java – Instance Variables

Demonstrates instance variables tied to objects.

Each object of EmployeeDetails has its own copy of the variables.

Shows how instance variables are initialized and accessed through objects.

3️⃣ College.java – Static Variables

Demonstrates static variables (class variables).

A static variable is shared among all instances of the class.

Shows how static variables can be accessed without creating objects.

Concepts Covered

Local Variables: Temporary variables used within methods.

Instance Variables: Object-specific variables stored in memory with each object.

Static Variables: Class-level variables shared by all instances.

Basic Java syntax for input/output, variable declaration, and arithmetic operations.
